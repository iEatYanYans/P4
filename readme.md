# Sleep Tracker

SleepTracker is a web application written and partially designed by Yan Chen. We believe that the quality of sleep is an essential part of a healthy lifestyle. SleepTracker takes the hard work out of managing your sleep by giving users the ability to easily log in and input their sleep hours. SleepTracker will then calculate the amount of sleep and output a visual graph.  

SleepTracker is an accessible and powerful tool made for you in mind.
